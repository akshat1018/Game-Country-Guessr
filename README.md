# Game-Country-Guessr
The 'COUNTRY GUESSR' game is a location / country guessing game in which players must guess the country using Google Street View and clues offered. The hints are centered on some social issue and social facts that makes guessing the country a little simpler. The game additionally aids in the advancement of information about various countries and their societal challenges. 
I used the Google Maps API to enable street view, and I enhanced the functionality with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


How to Play:
-> Press "Start Game" to be redirected to the game.
-> Once in the game, click on "Start/Guess". An alert will appear providing you with clues about the location.
-> Read the clues, close the alert, and use street view for additional information about the location.
-> When you have an idea about the country, press "Start/Guess" again and enter your answer.
-> If your guess is correct, your score will automatically increase
-> Repeat the process for new locations.
